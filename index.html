                <p>trust as a virtue has consistently played an essential role in <br>every great human achievement. and
                    consistently, its <br>importance has been overlooked. not just by individuals, but <br>by entire
                    societies. we felt it was time someone gave it the <br> spotlight it deserves. especially for the
                    ones who live by this <br> virtue: the trustworthy.</p>

                <p>so we thought of creating a system that rewards its members <br>for doing good and being trustworthy.
                    this way, trust as a <br> virtue becomes something to aspire to, just the way it should <br>be. then
                    we went one step ahead: we built it. we <br>know we are on the right track because here you are.</p>

                <p>
                    if you make it to CRED, congratulations and welcome. we <br>have a lot of things planned for you.
